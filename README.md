# Discord Knockoff
 *simple* discord knockoff I spent a few weeks on. All the backend in php, since that's all I have access to on my server. No websockets, just a spam of AJAX requests. Either way it works, and for once, I know why.

Did I mention the lack of security? And the missing files to handle user accounts :)
Teenagers get a right of passage for writing crappy code.
